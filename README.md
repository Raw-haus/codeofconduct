# Raw Haus Code Of Conduct
This is the Code of Conduct for all Raw Haus events and content. The following anti-harassment policy covers all Raw Haus events and activities and applies to all members, presenters, and other participants.

Raw Haus does not tolerate harassment in any form. We welcome everyone regardless of sex, race, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, age, physical appearance, religion/faith, national origin, source of income, and language preference. In fact, we love diversity!

Harassment includes but is not limited to: offensive verbal or written comments related to, or exclusion based on, any of the characteristics listed above (i.e. sex, race, gender, etc.); deliberate intimidation; following or stalking; unwanted photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; unwelcome sexual attention; and patronizing language or action.

Further, sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any Raw Haus event or activity, including talks.

Anyone in violation of this policy may be warned, expelled from the event, and/or banned from future Raw Haus activities, at the sole discretion of the Raw Haus leadership and the event organizers.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff immediately. Additionally, you can contact Amy Jung, at community@raw-haus.co. To the largest extent possible, reports of harassment will be kept confidential; usually, this means they will only be shared Raw Haus founders who are not involved in the incident and are directly dealing with anti-harassment enforcement, or with law enforcement/venue security should their presence become necessary.

Raw Haus leadership and/or event staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.

We value your participation and hope that by widely communicating these expectations we can all enjoy a welcoming environment.

Contributors to this Policy
This anti-harassment policy is based on Code for Americaâ€™s Anti-Harassment policy and the example policy from the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers. Those policies were in turn based on several others, including the Ohio LinuxFest anti-harassment policy, written by Esther Filderman and Beth Lynn Eicher, and the Con Anti-Harassment Project. Mary Gardiner, Valerie Aurora, Sarah Smith, and Donna Benjamin generalized the policies and added supporting material. Many members of LinuxChix, Geek Feminism and other groups contributed to this work. The policy shown above was edited into its present form by Ethan Resnick.
